## Design Context

### Users
Individuals seeking accessible, personalized, and integrated healthcare across Australia. They are looking for an alternative to cold, rushed traditional clinics, often seeking help for complex or sensitive issues like gut health, weight loss, plant-based therapies, and women's health. They value discretion, convenience (telehealth), and a holistic approach that treats the whole person.

### Brand Personality
**Trustworthy, Grounded, Empathetic**
The voice is professional yet warm, avoiding overly clinical jargon while maintaining medical authority. It should feel like a premium, inclusive safe space that reduces barriers to care.

### Aesthetic Direction
- **Visual Tone:** Warm, editorial, organic but structured. It should feel like a premium lifestyle brand that happens to provide medical care.
- **Color Palette (Derived from provided CSS):**
  - **Base:** Warm off-white (`hsl(0, 0%, 99.22%)`) and grounding dark brown/warm black (`hsl(30, 12.5%, 18.82%)`).
  - **Accents:** Muted, natural greens (`hsl(117.69, 10.92%, 53.33%)` and `hsl(116.47, 8.54%, 39.02%)`) and warm beige/sand (`hsl(38.18, 7.1%, 69.61%)`).
- **References:** Kin Fertility (for its empathetic, warm tone and editorial typography), Polln (for its clean information architecture and clear medical authority).
- **Anti-References:** Healthylife (avoid "discount pharmacy" or e-commerce clutter), generic ThemeForest medical templates (avoid stock "doctor pointing" imagery), and standard AI-generated interfaces (avoid glowing gradients and glassmorphism).

### Design Principles
1. **Empathy over Clinical Sterility:** Use the warm, tinted neutrals and editorial typography to create a safe, inviting space, explicitly avoiding harsh pure whites and generic "hospital blues".
2. **Medical Authority via Clarity:** Information architecture must be crystal clear. Use strict visual hierarchy and grid systems to guide users through complex medical offerings without overwhelming them.
3. **Intentional "Natural" Colors:** Use the provided earthy color tokens (muted greens, warm blacks, sand) for functional meaning (interactive states, prominent calls to action) rather than mere decoration.
4. **Inclusive by Design:** The interface must reflect the clinic's explicit commitment to cultural safety and accessibility, prioritizing high legibility, clear microcopy, and unambiguous navigation.
5. **No AI Fingerprints:** Strictly avoid the generic hallmarks of AI-generated design from 2024-2025. Every design choice must feel intentional, custom-crafted, and deeply human.
